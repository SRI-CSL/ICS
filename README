ICS 2.0: Integrated Canonizer and Solver
========================================

Decision procedure for the combination of t
heories based on Shostak's procedure. See also:

License:
--------

Please, carefully read and sign the license 
fm-license.pdf before starting to use ICS.


Requirements:
-------------

To compile ICS, you need to install first:
 
 - Objective Caml version 3.06 or later
   Available at http://caml.inria.fr

 - GNU MP version 4.1 or later
   Is part of the distribution of at least some Unix systems
   Available at http://www.swox.com/gmp/



Installation from sources  
-------------------------

ICS can be can build from sources by using the following sequence of shell 
commands in a directory of your choice.

       $ mkdir ics
       $ cd ics
       $ tar zxvf ics-2-0.tar.gz

An executable is build using the the commands.
    
      $ ./configure [--with-gmp=/path/to/gmp] [--prefix=/path/to/binaries]
      $ make

'configure' creates the Makefile from corresponding file Makefile.in,
whereas 'make' builds ICS.  If configure fails to find an appropriate GMP, 
the --with-gmp flag can be used to explicitly provide a path to the GMP library.

Now, the ICS interactor is called using

     $ ./ics

The executables and libraries can be installed in /path/to/binaries using

     $ make install
 
Binaries will be in ./bin/$(ARCH)/ 
Libraries in ./lib/$(ARCH)/

Build directory is ./obj/$(ARCH)/

Documentation is in ./doc


Problems
--------

Configure does not find required programs. In this case check your PATH variable.

Sometimes, the path to an appropriate GMP has to be given explicitly when configure
does not find one. E.g. ./configure --with-gmp=/local  if there is an appropriate
GMP library in /local/lib

and patched for ocaml 3.00 by Jean-Christophe Filliâtre.
