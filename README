ICS 2.1: Integrated Canonizer and Solver
========================================

Ground decision procedure for the combination of
theories based on Shostak's procedure. See also:

http://ics.csl.sri.com


License:
--------

Please, carefully read and sign the license 
fm-license.pdf before starting to use ICS.


Requirements:
-------------

To compile ICS, you need to install first:
 
 - Objective Caml version 3.06 or later
   Available at http://caml.inria.fr



Installation from sources  
-------------------------

ICS can be built from sources using the following 
sequence of shell commands in a directory of your 
choice.

       $ tar zxvf ics-2-1.tar.gz
       $ cd ics-2-1

An executable is build using the the commands.
    
      $ ./configure [--prefix=/path/to/binaries]
      $ make

'configure' creates the Makefile from corresponding file Makefile.in,
whereas 'make' builds ICS. 

Binaries will be in ./bin/$(ARCH)/ 
Libraries in ./lib/$(ARCH)/
Build directory is ./obj/$(ARCH)/
Documentation is in ./doc

Now, the ICS interactor is called using

     $ ./ics

The executables and libraries can be installed in /path/to/binaries using

     $ make install



Problems
--------

Configure does not find required programs. 
In this case check your PATH variable.
