ICS 2.1:  Integrated Canonizer and Solver
========================================

Decision procedure for the combination of t
heories based on Shostak's procedure. See also:

License:
--------

Please, carefully read and sign the license 
fm-license.pdf before starting to use ICS.


Requirements:
-------------

To compile ICS, you need to install first:
 
 - Objective Caml version 3.08 or later
   Available at http://caml.inria.fr


Installation from sources  
-------------------------

ICS can be can build from sources by using the following sequence of shell 
commands in a directory of your choice.

       $ mkdir ics
       $ cd ics
       $ tar zxvf ics-2-0.tar.gz

An executable is build using the the commands.
    
      $ ./configure [--prefix=/path/to/binaries]
      $ make

'configure' creates the Makefile from corresponding file Makefile.in,
whereas 'make' builds ICS.  If configure fails to find an appropriate GMP, 
the --with-gmp flag can be used to explicitly provide a path to the GMP library.

Now, the ICS interactor is called using

     $ ./ics

The executables and libraries can be installed in /path/to/binaries using

     $ make install
 
Binaries will be in ./bin/$(ARCH)/ 
Libraries in ./lib/$(ARCH)/

Build directory is ./obj/$(ARCH)/

Documentation is in ./doc


Problems
--------

Configure does not find required programs. In this case check your PATH variable.


Changes: 
--------

Version 2.0
  - to do

Version 1.1 
  - more efficient inequality reasoning
  - support for extensional arrays
  - updated list solver
