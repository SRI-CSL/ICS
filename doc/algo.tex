\section*{Shostak's algorithm}

\ocwsection\label{algo}
This chapter describes the algorithm. It assumes canonization
functions and solvers for the theories, through the module
\textit{Interp}. The implementation of these functions for the various
theories will be described in a later chapter (\fullrefsec{theo}).
The algorithm itself is contained in the module \textit{Shostak}.
